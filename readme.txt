== Description ==

This plugin helps you to limit the number of posts/pages/custom post types each user can create on your site.
This means that if you have a multiple author,editor and other roles users in your blog and you want to limit 
the number of posts or page each author can post you can do it using this plugin. We hope to extend this plugin quickly to meet 
your requests. It's simple and very fast and its scope is the creation of new post or page through new-post.php; if you don't know new-post.php
page is used also to create new static page because for Wordpress a page is a particular post.
N.B. Administrator users are not limited; this plugin is not tested on multisite install but probably it works like we expect

**Main Feature:**

*   Set time period 
*   Limit number of pages per type of user Role
*   Limit number of posts per type of user Role
*   Exclude special users.
